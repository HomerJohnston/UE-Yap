Description: Settings for a node type

[EXCERPT:EditorIconsPath]
Supports .svg or .png image types. Yap displays these at 16x16 and 24x24 px.

Filenames should exactly match full gameplay tag names.

The path starts from the project root (the folder containing your .uproject file).

**Example**

**If you would like your mood icons to be organized like this:**

- X:/Project/ProjectName.uproject
- X:/Project/Resources/Yap/MoodIcons/Common/Yap.Mood.Common.Calm.svg
- X:/Project/Resources/Yap/MoodIcons/Common/Yap.Mood.Common.Angry.svg

**Then you would want to change this setting to this:**

- Resources/Yap/MoodIcons/Common

---

**By default, Yap will search here for mood icons:**
- Resources/DefaultMoodIcons
[/EXCERPT:EditorIconsPath]
